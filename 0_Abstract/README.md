In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring heat. This circuit is developed using “Atmega328”, a linear voltage sensor.Heat is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faranheit” and used the SimuleIDE Software.Mostly used in vehicles to make sure that the equipments used are working efficiently in cold weather.It takes an analog input and generates a temperature accordingly via master slave communication.
